Tennis Score Processor is a Java based library that records and processes tennis match data on a stroke-by-stroke or point-by-point bases. 

## Overview
Tennis Score Processor uses a main processor object called ```MatchProcessor``` to update and modify the ```Match``` object, a simple POJO containing match data.  See the following diagram:

## Usage

### Use Cases
Use Tennis Score Processor to:  

* Record match data on a stroke-by-stroke or point-by-point basis
* Analyze recorded match data
* Process tennis scoring results in real-time
* Build a real working tennis scoreboard
* Whatever else your imagine can dream up!

### Get Started
Getting started with Tennis Score Processor is easy. Create a ```Match``` entity and update it with the necessary information for the processor to be able to perform updates. See the following code sample:  

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

	// Build the match data
	Player player1 = new Player("Roger", "Federer");
	Player player2 = new Player("Rafael", "Nadal");
		
	List<Player> players = new ArrayList<>();
	players.add(player1);
	players.add(player2);
		
	// Initialize the playerConfig data
	PlayerConfig playerConfig = new PlayerConfig(players, player1, player2);
		
	// Utilize the framework's match factory to create a new match entity
	MatchFactory matchFactory = new DefaultMatchFactory();
		
	// Instantiate the matchProcessor
	MatchProcessor matchProcessor = new MatchProcessor(matchFactory.create(new MatchRules(), playerConfig));
		
	// Use the matchProcessor to update match results on stroke or point basis
	matchProcessor.update(new Stroke(player1, StrokeType.FIRST_SERVE, false, true));
}
```
