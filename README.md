# Tennis Charter
> Tennis Charter is an open source project dedicated to collecting, analyzing, and sharing tennis match analytics using modern technologies. 

Most of the technology out in the software world for collecting tennis analytics is not readily accessible or easy to integrate with. Most of the good services are also not free. Tennis charter seeks to fix that by building a processing program that can collect, analyze, and provide that data back to clients at little to no cost. Sync up with Tennis Charter to store match data on a stroke-by-stroke basis, or strap a UI onto it and build a scoring application.

The application is currently in it's discovery phase. Contributions are welcome. Tennis enthusiasts are extremely welcome!
